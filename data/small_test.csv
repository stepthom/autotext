Josephs interest in farming is partly attributed to his parents, who were recognized for their outstanding abilities in farming. They had a big farm, so his parents didnt have to lease any land. Joseph is the first born in their family and had to help a lot with farm work. Six years ago his brother was disabled through a tragic road accident. According to their culture, it is one's obligation to take care of all of the dependants when the parents are not in a position to do so, and Joseph assumed responsibility for his brother's children. Since then, he has never been in a position to provide sufficiently for his family. He is requesting to be funded with US$1200, of which US$900 will be used to buy 2 dairy cows, US$180 to buy seeds and fertilizers, and US$120 to buy mineral salts and feeds for the cows.
